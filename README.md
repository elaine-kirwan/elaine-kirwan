## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Elaine

I'm a data & analytics director based in Dublin, Ireland - and extremely lucky to be working with the incredibly talented & sound team over at [Gym+Coffee](https://gympluscoffee.com)

### ðŸ¤“ Iâ€™m working on

- A portfolio of data tips, tricks & tidbits - anything that might help simplify and speed things up for other devs and users
- Advanced data use cases in our custom data platform (mainly GCP and Power BI) that drive home new insights & business value
- Exploring how AI can help Gym+Coffee to level-up growth as we scale (fast) ðŸš€ 

### ðŸ“« Talk data (or dogs) to me
